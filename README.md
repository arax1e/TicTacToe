# TicTacToe

## About this App
This app allows the user(s) to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. 

## How to Use
In order to use this app, the user will need to download the code and run it on a local server. 

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
I would like to implement a number of improvements to this app. First, I'd like to clean up the style a bit, so that the game looks more like a handwritten Tic Tac Toe game. I'd also like to make the colors change based on which player is playing, and ensure that a square can't be played twice.
